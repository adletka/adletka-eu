    <h1>ICPhS 2023: A Perceptual and acoustic study of melody in
whispered Czech words</h1>

<p>The perception of melody in speech depends mainly on the
fundamental frequency which reflects vocal fold oscillation
speed. Whisper is defined by the absence of phonation and therefore
the lack of fundamental frequency. Intended melody in whisper, however, seems to be discernible regardless.</p>

<p>This paper presents a perception experiment assessing the
discernibility of melody in whispered Czech words and words sung in
whisper, which proved that melody in whisper in certain cases can in
fact be discerned, along with an acoustical analysis of the effect of
intended melody in whisper on formant frequencies, formant to formant
ratios, center of gravity (CoG) and spectral slope. The parameters
affected by intended melody in whispered speech were F2 and CoG of
stop-band filtered signal with main formant bandwidths removed. In
words sung in whisper, the affected parameters were F2, F3, F2:F1 and
F3:F2 ratios, CoG and spectral slope.</p>
